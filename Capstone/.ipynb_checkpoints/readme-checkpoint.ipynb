    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to predict the winners of NBA games using box score statistics from a game.  The ultimate goal is to create a profitable betting strategy.  This represents the first steps in this process\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this analysis was obtain from an existing Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats). The dataset covers six seasons, 2012 to 2017.  There are 30 teams in the league that play an 82 game season for a total of 7,380 games over the six seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic framework used was a four factor model.  The overall elements of the model are shooting, turnovers, rebounding and free throws. Several variables make up each of these elements. A logistic regression was conducted on both the data for individual games and a five game moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages were imported to conduct this analysis.\n",

    "## 4. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "While the initial models showed showed high levels of accuracy, they were much less predictive of teams with more losses.  Employing moving averages reduced the level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps are:\n",
    "    * Creating and employing better metrics\n",
    "    * Looking for more interactions\n",
    "    * Calculating the model's winning probabilities\n",
    "    * Creating Pythagorean Expectation and Log 5 Models\n",
    "    * Looking for value against moneylines"

The boy coughs up two of the pennies, but keeps choking.

Looking at his son, panicking, the father starts shouting for help.

A well dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.

At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.

After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last penny, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.

Releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the penny.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, “I’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?”

So he makes his way to Zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the Gods. Along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. Their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. The hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. A ways further and he sees Hercules, Chuck Norris, and even Atlas, who held up the sky for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. The hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. If these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could I? But the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.
  

The hero had finally reached Zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. ""Welcome, great hero. If you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. Here is a jar of peanut butter. Please open the jar without using any hot water."" The hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.
  

""Very good"" says Zeus. ""For the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs."" As a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. He picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to Zeus's refrigerator.
  

""You give me hope, challenger! Perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. The feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! I have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. Retrieve the sword for me and I will present you the final challenge."" The hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. He notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. He presents the sword to Zeus.
  

""Hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. No mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as Hercules, Chuck Norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. Complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary Pantheon.

One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down.   This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit.”Oh, my,” said the bunny, “I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I’ve been blind since birth, so I can’t see where I’m going. In fact, since I’m also an orphan, I don’t even know what I am.”  “It’s quite OK,” replied the snake. “Actually, my story is much the same as yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and find out what you are, so at least you’ll have that going for you.”  “Oh, that would be wonderful” replied the bunny.  So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, “Well, you’re covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I’d say that you must be a bunny rabbit.”  “Oh, thank you! Thank you,” cried the bunny, in obvious excitement.  The bunny suggested to the snake, “Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you’ve helped me.”  So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, “Well, you’re smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone, and no balls.

t3_cadbzz,0,Jokes,"This is a true story, inasmuch as any story is true. I once lived in a small town in a rural part of Oregon and worked as the night desk clerk at a motel just across from a truck stop. One night a customer came in wearing bib overalls over a flannel shirt and asked for a room for a couple weeks, paying all in advance.

He explained he was a nearby farmer who was having his house expanded because he had three girlfriends who were all going to move in with him. It was late at night, so I didn't mind a little conversation to break the monotony. Well, over that next couple weeks, he was a regular for our continental breakfast and we'd chat. He was a friendly enough guy, but I did notice he was a pretty heavy drinker. Some nights I knew would be dead, we'd share a fifth of bourbon in our lobby.

Well, eventually the two weeks was up, and he got a call. Since we'd gotten to be pals, he asked if I wouldn't like to come out and see the house and meet his three girlfriends. I had kind of forgotten about his swinging by that point, but I figured what the hell, why not.

We climb into his pickup, and it's a pretty good ride from my work site out to his farm. It's a pretty decent size acreage, and toward the back is a really nicely done farmhouse. We step up onto the wide porch and the front door opens to display a naked woman standing there. Just stark naked. Now that would've been pretty nice, except this girl is sorta... unfortunate-looking.

Tall, painfully skinny, stringy blonde hair. It's like somebody taught a mop to stand upright and walk around.

My friend leans down and says, ""I don't rightly remember her actual name, I jus' call her Corona.""

I didn't know what to say to that, so I kinda stumble out with, ""Because she's, uhhh... cool and refreshing?""

He laughs. ""Naw, 'cause I was drunk as hell after a case of Corona when I hooked up with 'er!""

The woman leads us into the living room, and we sit. She brings us each a nice cold beer. Just then the bedroom door opens and out comes a second woman. The farmer grins real big and I look.

Well, she's about five foot even and probably 350 pounds or more. Face like a pug, hair like a scorched tumbleweed, and a scowl that would make a rattler think twice about biting her. The farmer says, ""This here's Tequila!""

I didn't know what to even say to that except: ""Why would you name her...""

""Yup, 'at's right!"" he guffaws. ""I's blackout drunk on Patron when I hooked up with 'er!""

At this point I'm just sitting there with a thousand yard stare. And then I hear it. The sound nobody ever wants to hear, the sound everybody who's seen an old horror film knows instinctively.

From somewhere in the back of the house, the door of what could only have been a fruit cellar starts to s-l-o-w-l-y *crrrrrrrreeeeaaaak* open.

One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike, the dealer asks if he would like some extra chrome protection added to the bill. The young man is upset because he does not have the extra money, and is now afraid that the chrome will rust as soon as it gets wet. 


The dealer tells him not to worry. There is an old biker trick that will keep the chrome like new. All he has to do is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains - and everything will be fine. The young man happily pays for the bike and leaves. 

A few months later, the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointment time, he picks her up on his new Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.

 After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes, the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family. And no one says a word....... Next he decides to take a more direct approach, so he throws her on the table and makes love to her in front of everyone. And no one says a word..... Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder relations. Yet no one says a word..... By now he is getting very worried and is thinking what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance.

tornados and droughts-not the current situation, where the Wild West means California and you have to brave hottubs, mellowspeak, fires and
earthquakes. That is, it was a simpler time.)

So, Fred found his way to a frontier town and became the bartender at the wildest saloon in the territory. He soon proved how rough and
tough he was, and the owner of the bar was pleased with how he broke up fights and didn't skim too much off the receipts. He told Fred that he (Fred) was doing a fine job, but he should remember one thing: 

""If you ever hear even a rumor that Mad Martin is coming to town, just save what you can, put a bottle of Red Eye on the counter, and head out of
town as fast as you can.""

Fred was pretty perplexed at this, and sought explanation. He was told that Mad Martin was an old mountain man who lived up in the hills
and only came to town once or twice a year. However, Martin was the most dangerous guy they'd ever heard of and few had ever encountered him and lived to tell the tale. 

Fred listened carefully and then promptly forgot all about it. Until, one day a few months later, a cowboy came riding through town at full speed, yelling, ""Martin's coming! Head for the hills!"" The result was incredible. Everybody in town immediately jumped on their horses and took off for the hills. Except Fred. He wanted to see this guy because he didn't believe he could be all that tough. So, Fred just put the bottle of Red Eye on the bar, hid behind the counter, and waited.

He didn't wait long. Soon there was a noise in the street. As Fred looked out a hole in the wall, he saw this huge, mean-looking guy ride down the center of the street on the biggest bull buffalo that Fred had ever seen. The guy stopped the buffalo in front of the bar, jumped off the beast, punched it in the head (dropping the critter to its knees) and bellowed, ""Wait here til I get back!"" 

The fellow turned and walked up the steps. Fred saw that the guy had a pair of huge mountain lions on leashes. He tied them both to a post and kicked them soundly, hollering, ""You pussycats stay here til I'm done!"" The cats fearfully sat down.

Into the bar stormed the fellow, ripping the doors off the wall as he passed. With two strides he approached the bar, picked up the bottle of Red Eye, bit off the neck, and downed it all in one gulp. Poor Fred, thoroughly frightened by now, let out a little whimper. The guy klooked down over the bar and roared, ""What the hell do you think you're looking at!?""

Fred managed to say, ""N..n..n..nothing, mister. Do you want another bottle of Red Eye?"" To which the fellow replied, ""Hell no! I don't have time! I gotta get out of here-Mad Martin's coming!""",1562375334.0,"Once upon a time, this guy named Fred decided that he was rough and tough enough to seek his fortune in the Wild West."

t3_caetoy,7,Jokes,"As a singer I sing at many funerals &amp; I was recently asked by a funeral director to play &amp; sing at a graveside service for a homeless man.  He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery out in the country.  As I was not familiar with the area, I got lost.  I finally arrived an hour late and saw that the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight.  There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.  I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late.  I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place.  I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.  The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around.  I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends.  I sang  like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

As I sang &amp; played “Amazing Grace”, the workers began to weep.  They wept, I wept, we all wept together.  When I finished, I packed up my keyboard and started for my car.  Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I’ve never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost….",1562549862.0,Late to a funeral

Bob, disappointed he didn’t get the judges to laugh as much as he wanted, shakes his head at it and reassures himself it’s a fluke and he will rock the crowd on Saturday.
 

Saturday rolls around and Bob is next to go on stage. He gets up there and starts. His act is insane and wacky. Bob the ant is going nuts. But the crowd isn’t laughing. Disappointedly, Bob walks off stage to the audience after his set to reflect on why he wasn’t so funny. As he does this, the next ant comedian walks on stage.

So he makes his way to Zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the Gods. Along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. Their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. The hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. A ways further and he sees Hercules, Chuck Norris, and even Atlas, who held up the sky for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. The hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. If these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could I? But the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.
  

The hero had finally reached Zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. ""Welcome, great hero. If you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. Here is a jar of peanut butter. Please open the jar without using any hot water."" The hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.
  

""Very good"" says Zeus. ""For the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs."" As a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. He picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to Zeus's refrigerator.
  

""You give me hope, challenger! Perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. The feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! I have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. Retrieve the sword for me and I will present you the final challenge."" The hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. He notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. He presents the sword to Zeus.
  

""Hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. No mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as Hercules, Chuck Norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. Complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary Pantheon.

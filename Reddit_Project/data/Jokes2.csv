He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.

The doctor set the pain transfer to 10%.

However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and “kick it up a notch.”

t3_c9g9wh,3,Jokes,"Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors. Tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything Timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. He knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. When he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. He was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. Timmy seriously loved tractors.

As Timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. He yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new John Deere for his 18th birthday. He could barely contain himself.

Finally, the big day arrived. He was 18! He woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new John Deere tractor. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIMMY! Was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. He ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. He ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. He had never felt this way before!

But enough was enough. It was time.

He climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. It was perfect. He had waited 18 years for this moment. His hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. He quickly turned it and…

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

It didn't start. That's odd. Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Again? This is weird. Bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Timmy froze. The tractor wouldn't start. He was let down, betrayed. His whole life up to this point had been a lie. There was a paradigm shift in every fiber of Timmy's being.

Something inside Timmy snapped.

Timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. He ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. Screaming like a possessed Viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. The windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. Then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. He stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.

Timmy walked away, to a bar. He was 18 now, and he needed a drink. He sat down and ordered a beer. Timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. He was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. Thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. Everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. This smoke was from a tractor and it made Timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.

Everybody stared at him in stunned silence. No one moved. The bartender spoke for everyone in the room

""How on earth did you do that?""

Timmy slowly turned to him. ""I'm an ex tractor fan""",1562335272.0,Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors.

One, he is an undead skeleton retired from being a lowly exp grind mob, and two, is able to open any lock. His skills are unrivaled, but when even he is stumped, he can detach one of his bones to utilize as a tool. All of his bones are still in control of the skeleton, even if they are detached, giving him very precise movements when opening a lock. His fame reached the ears of millions, and thousands flock him ever day, some requesting to become an apprentice, others begging to open a lock that they lost a key to, and finally, the bold who challenges the locksmith in opening an impossible lock. The skeleton is able to open all of the challengers locks with ease, but he will never forget the one time he was bested.

It was an old sage, seemingly on the verge of collapse, carrying a small box with an equally small lock. The sage had traveled many a distance to see if the legendary locksmith will be able to open the lock of pandora's box. ""It was locked by the gods, so therefore a being that defies the wills of the gods is the only one who will be able to crack it open!"" 

Naturally, the skeleton couldn't resist the challenge and worked his magic right away. It was a simple lock  he thought, but as his tools came in contact with the metal of the lock, they simply vanished from his skeletal hands. Carefully, he took off one of his fingers off his left hand and skillfully maneuvered it into the gaping hole. Steadily to not come in contact with the walls of the inside. Painstakingly working, the skeleton was just about complete when he made a  horrible mistake. The ridges suddenly changed, the gods's magic reanraaging the interior of the lock and bumping into the bone multiple times. While at first nothing happened, soon his finger, unable to handle the multitude of curse that was lain on the lock, cracked. Defeated, the skeleton withdrew the finger, just as shattered as his now broken finger. The sage just sighed, exhausted from the many years of wandering, and picked up the box. Their parting word were, ""I will be back.""

The skeleton from that point was determined to open the lock. He took challengers from across the continent, and even traveled to foreign lands to compete with the greatest locksmiths ever seen before. It was just a normal day when he see a familiar hunched back figure making it's way towards him. Without a word, the sage placed the same box before him. The skeleton smiled, his bones creaking as skeletons lack the muscles, and the flesh to show that emotion, and uttered one phrase.

Big Joel helped him through his day, showing him where to eat, shower, and work out. Myto woke up every morning and had a Chocolate Brownie for breakfast.

Big Joel shook his head and sighed. “Don’t know why it’s got to be this way. It just do. Power goes out every night at 9.” Myto was perplexed. He resolved to fix this issue using all his electrical engineering prowess. He realized that by using the strange brownies made by Dria, he could make a con brownie.

Jim went to the bar after work one day and sat down next to a local. ""I just moved into town a few days ago,"" Jim told the man, ""and I've barely seen a single woman here.""

""Yeah, there's not a lot of females around these parts,"" the man responded. ""But we all get by.""

The next day, Jim, on his way to work, drove past a farm and saw a man fucking a cow in the field. And every day, for the next month, Jim saw a different man in that field having sex with a cow.

Eventually Jim went back to the bar and sat down next to the same local. ""It's the strangest thing,"" Jim said. ""Every day on my way to work I see some guy banging a cow on Miller's farm.""

""I told you there aren't many females around here,"" the man said. ""But we all get by.""

The next day, Jim - nearing the end of his sexual rope - decided to stop at the farm on his way to work. As he started giving the business to one of Miller's cows, a small crowd of men gathered around him, pointing and laughing. ""What are you all laughing at?"" Jim exclaimed.

The boy smiled at the young woman and she started a conversation with him.

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on.

The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

After a few minutes, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely.

Now completely nude, she purred at him,

""What would you say is my best feature?"" Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""It's got to be your ears.""

Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""My ears? Look at these breasts; they are full and 100% natural. I work out every day and my butt is firm and solid. Look at my skin - no blemishes anywhere, so how can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?!""

t3_c8qsuw,4,Jokes,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

Father,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

Father,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

Dear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

Dearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

Father,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-'

The General Manager next to him said he did it 5 times on his wedding night.

Then a couple of others said 4 times, 5 times and so on and finally all turned towards a fresher clerk who seemed to be rather shy and asked how many times did he do it on his wedding night.

The clerk replied: ""Only once Sir!"".

t3_c9g9wh,3,Jokes,"Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors. Tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything Timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. He knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. When he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. He was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. Timmy seriously loved tractors.

As Timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. He yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new John Deere for his 18th birthday. He could barely contain himself.

Finally, the big day arrived. He was 18! He woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new John Deere tractor. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIMMY! Was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. He ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. He ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. He had never felt this way before!

But enough was enough. It was time.

He climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. It was perfect. He had waited 18 years for this moment. His hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. He quickly turned it and…

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

It didn't start. That's odd. Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Again? This is weird. Bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Timmy froze. The tractor wouldn't start. He was let down, betrayed. His whole life up to this point had been a lie. There was a paradigm shift in every fiber of Timmy's being.

Something inside Timmy snapped.

Timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. He ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. Screaming like a possessed Viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. The windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. Then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. He stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.

Timmy walked away, to a bar. He was 18 now, and he needed a drink. He sat down and ordered a beer. Timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. He was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. Thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. Everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. This smoke was from a tractor and it made Timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.

Everybody stared at him in stunned silence. No one moved. The bartender spoke for everyone in the room

""How on earth did you do that?""

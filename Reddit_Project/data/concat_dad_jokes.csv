""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

The Russian politician replies, ""There aren't many black people in Russia.""",1562579928.0,"An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician.

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

t3_castnv,6,dadjokes,"There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",1562629165.0,There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...

Her bag of groceries was especially heavy that day, and as she passed Nathan Hale's Used Cars, she got an idea that she could drive herself to the store and save a lot of shoe leather, time and aching muscles. She walks into the car dealership and, as it just so happens, gets the owner himself. He asks her what kind of car she wants and she replies,

""Well, sonny, I can't remember the name exactly, but it has something to do with hate or anger.""

The owner replies, ""Well, let's see... Oh yes, you want a Plymouth Fury! We have a couple on the lot. What color do you prefer?""

The lady has some trouble explaining the exact color to him, so she reaches into her shopping bag, takes out an ear of corn, strips down the shucks and says, ""I want this color sonny.""

To which Nathan replies, ""Ma'am I'm sorry, but we don't have any in this color. Could I show you a nice blue one?""

""No son, I want this color.""

""But ma'am, they didn't make that color! Maybe a cherry red one would suit you?"" says the owner, obviously worried about losing a sale.

By this time, the old lady gets mad, and starts throwing things at the owner, thereby chasing him out of the office and into the lot. One of the salesmen, coming into the office from the back door, notices the disruption and asks the secretary what the old woman was so upset about.

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

The tattoo artist is very good at his job, and says he can get this done in one session, so the officer sits down and the artist gets started.

t3_castnv,6,dadjokes,"There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",1562629165.0,There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...

Her bag of groceries was especially heavy that day, and as she passed Nathan Hale's Used Cars, she got an idea that she could drive herself to the store and save a lot of shoe leather, time and aching muscles. She walks into the car dealership and, as it just so happens, gets the owner himself. He asks her what kind of car she wants and she replies,

""Well, sonny, I can't remember the name exactly, but it has something to do with hate or anger.""

The owner replies, ""Well, let's see... Oh yes, you want a Plymouth Fury! We have a couple on the lot. What color do you prefer?""

The lady has some trouble explaining the exact color to him, so she reaches into her shopping bag, takes out an ear of corn, strips down the shucks and says, ""I want this color sonny.""

To which Nathan replies, ""Ma'am I'm sorry, but we don't have any in this color. Could I show you a nice blue one?""

""No son, I want this color.""

""But ma'am, they didn't make that color! Maybe a cherry red one would suit you?"" says the owner, obviously worried about losing a sale.

By this time, the old lady gets mad, and starts throwing things at the owner, thereby chasing him out of the office and into the lot. One of the salesmen, coming into the office from the back door, notices the disruption and asks the secretary what the old woman was so upset about.

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

The Russian politician replies, ""There aren't many black people in Russia.""",1562579928.0,"An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician.

t3_castnv,6,dadjokes,"There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",1562629165.0,There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...

t3_car7es,0,dadjokes,"One day, an elderly woman was walking along the street, coming home from the supermarket. Her bag of groceries was especially heavy that day, and as she passed Nathan Hale's Used Cars, she got an idea that she could drive herself to the store and save a lot of shoe leather, time and aching muscles. She walks into the car dealership and, as it just so happens, gets the owner himself. He asks her what kind of car she wants and she replies,

""Well, sonny, I can't remember the name exactly, but it has something to do with hate or anger.""

The owner replies, ""Well, let's see... Oh yes, you want a Plymouth Fury! We have a couple on the lot. What color do you prefer?""

The lady has some trouble explaining the exact color to him, so she reaches into her shopping bag, takes out an ear of corn, strips down the shucks and says, ""I want this color sonny.""

To which Nathan replies, ""Ma'am I'm sorry, but we don't have any in this color. Could I show you a nice blue one?""

""No son, I want this color.""

""But ma'am, they didn't make that color! Maybe a cherry red one would suit you?"" says the owner, obviously worried about losing a sale.

By this time, the old lady gets mad, and starts throwing things at the owner, thereby chasing him out of the office and into the lot. One of the salesmen, coming into the office from the back door, notices the disruption and asks the secretary what the old woman was so upset about.

The secretary replies, ""Apparently, Hale hath no Fury like the woman's corn!""",1562621205.0,Just yellow please

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Greetings, comrade."" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, ""I think you are American spy.""

The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, ""That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!""

He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.

""Very good, very good!"" says the politician. ""But I still think you are spy.""

The man continues to keep his cool.

""I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!""

He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.

""Amazing! You are skilled!"" says the politician.

The spy smirks.

""But I still think you American spy.""

The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.

He replies, ""I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!""

The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.

The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.

After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.

In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, ""You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.""

The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.

""Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?""

The Russian politician replies, ""There aren't many black people in Russia.""",1562579928.0,"An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician.

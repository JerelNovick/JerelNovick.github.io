t3_c9t7y7,2,Jokes,"A young man has always dreamed of owning a Harley Davidson
One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike, the dealer asks if he would like some extra chrome protection added to the bill. The young man is upset because he does not have the extra money, and is now afraid that the chrome will rust as soon as it gets wet. 


The dealer tells him not to worry. There is an old biker trick that will keep the chrome like new. All he has to do is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains - and everything will be fine. The young man happily pays for the bike and leaves. 

A few months later, the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointment time, he picks her up on his new Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.

 After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes, the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family. And no one says a word....... Next he decides to take a more direct approach, so he throws her on the table and makes love to her in front of everyone. And no one says a word..... Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder relations. Yet no one says a word..... By now he is getting very worried and is thinking what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance. 

His first thought is to protect the chrome on his new Harley, so he reaches in his pocket and pulls out his jar of Vaseline. And the father says

tornados and droughts-not the current situation, where the Wild West means California and you have to brave hottubs, mellowspeak, fires and
earthquakes. That is, it was a simpler time.)

So, Fred found his way to a frontier town and became the bartender at the wildest saloon in the territory. He soon proved how rough and
tough he was, and the owner of the bar was pleased with how he broke up fights and didn't skim too much off the receipts. He told Fred that he (Fred) was doing a fine job, but he should remember one thing: 

""If you ever hear even a rumor that Mad Martin is coming to town, just save what you can, put a bottle of Red Eye on the counter, and head out of
town as fast as you can.""

Fred was pretty perplexed at this, and sought explanation. He was told that Mad Martin was an old mountain man who lived up in the hills
and only came to town once or twice a year. However, Martin was the most dangerous guy they'd ever heard of and few had ever encountered him and lived to tell the tale. 

Fred listened carefully and then promptly forgot all about it. Until, one day a few months later, a cowboy came riding through town at full speed, yelling, ""Martin's coming! Head for the hills!"" The result was incredible. Everybody in town immediately jumped on their horses and took off for the hills. Except Fred. He wanted to see this guy because he didn't believe he could be all that tough. So, Fred just put the bottle of Red Eye on the bar, hid behind the counter, and waited.

He didn't wait long. Soon there was a noise in the street. As Fred looked out a hole in the wall, he saw this huge, mean-looking guy ride down the center of the street on the biggest bull buffalo that Fred had ever seen. The guy stopped the buffalo in front of the bar, jumped off the beast, punched it in the head (dropping the critter to its knees) and bellowed, ""Wait here til I get back!"" 

The fellow turned and walked up the steps. Fred saw that the guy had a pair of huge mountain lions on leashes. He tied them both to a post and kicked them soundly, hollering, ""You pussycats stay here til I'm done!"" The cats fearfully sat down.

Into the bar stormed the fellow, ripping the doors off the wall as he passed. With two strides he approached the bar, picked up the bottle of Red Eye, bit off the neck, and downed it all in one gulp. Poor Fred, thoroughly frightened by now, let out a little whimper. The guy klooked down over the bar and roared, ""What the hell do you think you're looking at!?""

Fred managed to say, ""N..n..n..nothing, mister. Do you want another bottle of Red Eye?"" To which the fellow replied, ""Hell no! I don't have time! I gotta get out of here-Mad Martin's coming!""",1562375334.0,"Once upon a time, this guy named Fred decided that he was rough and tough enough to seek his fortune in the Wild West."

His guide, the sly cajun he is, says, ""Oh, but now son, that ain't no ordinary dog; and you better know they may try and rip you off.""

The man, surprised says, ""Really!? he looks like an ordinary dog! how can you tell?""

&amp;#x200B;

The guide squats down by the dog and motions with his finger, ""come here son."" And the man stoops down also. He lifts up his tail and points, saying, ""See how small his butt-hole is?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, intrigued, says, ""Yeah?\`"" And the guide explains, ""A duck-dogs butt-hole is real small so he can't fill up with water and drown, you hear that?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man perks up and shouts, ""yeah, man, thanks!"" The two shake, and the man heads off, going to get a dog the next day before he leaves.

As he drives through town, he sees a sign up, ""dogs for sale,"" and he goes and checks'em out. He examines each dog, waiting for someone to come see him. Tibideaux walks up and with a look of horror and shock on his face, says, as calmly as he can, ""Man, what are you doin'!?""

t3_c9g9wh,3,Jokes,"Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors. Tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything Timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. He knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. When he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. He was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. Timmy seriously loved tractors.

As Timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. He yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new John Deere for his 18th birthday. He could barely contain himself.

Finally, the big day arrived. He was 18! He woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new John Deere tractor. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIMMY! Was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. He ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. He ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. He had never felt this way before!

But enough was enough. It was time.

He climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. It was perfect. He had waited 18 years for this moment. His hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. He quickly turned it and…

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

It didn't start. That's odd. Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Again? This is weird. Bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Timmy froze. The tractor wouldn't start. He was let down, betrayed. His whole life up to this point had been a lie. There was a paradigm shift in every fiber of Timmy's being.

Something inside Timmy snapped.

Timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. He ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. Screaming like a possessed Viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. The windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. Then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. He stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.

Timmy walked away, to a bar. He was 18 now, and he needed a drink. He sat down and ordered a beer. Timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. He was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. Thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. Everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. This smoke was from a tractor and it made Timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.

Everybody stared at him in stunned silence. No one moved. The bartender spoke for everyone in the room

The cop begins to get angry. ""Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me."" The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man. 

""Don't do that!"" the man yells fearfully. ""I'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" The cop pulls his hand out. ""Wait here,"" he says. 

The cop calls for backup. Soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. The man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. However, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""Sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However, we found none of these things in your car.""

t3_c9bm1p,0,Jokes,"In a land far far away, lives a locksmith. This locksmith however, has two very special traits. One, he is an undead skeleton retired from being a lowly exp grind mob, and two, is able to open any lock. His skills are unrivaled, but when even he is stumped, he can detach one of his bones to utilize as a tool. All of his bones are still in control of the skeleton, even if they are detached, giving him very precise movements when opening a lock. His fame reached the ears of millions, and thousands flock him ever day, some requesting to become an apprentice, others begging to open a lock that they lost a key to, and finally, the bold who challenges the locksmith in opening an impossible lock. The skeleton is able to open all of the challengers locks with ease, but he will never forget the one time he was bested.

It was an old sage, seemingly on the verge of collapse, carrying a small box with an equally small lock. The sage had traveled many a distance to see if the legendary locksmith will be able to open the lock of pandora's box. ""It was locked by the gods, so therefore a being that defies the wills of the gods is the only one who will be able to crack it open!"" 

Naturally, the skeleton couldn't resist the challenge and worked his magic right away. It was a simple lock  he thought, but as his tools came in contact with the metal of the lock, they simply vanished from his skeletal hands. Carefully, he took off one of his fingers off his left hand and skillfully maneuvered it into the gaping hole. Steadily to not come in contact with the walls of the inside. Painstakingly working, the skeleton was just about complete when he made a  horrible mistake. The ridges suddenly changed, the gods's magic reanraaging the interior of the lock and bumping into the bone multiple times. While at first nothing happened, soon his finger, unable to handle the multitude of curse that was lain on the lock, cracked. Defeated, the skeleton withdrew the finger, just as shattered as his now broken finger. The sage just sighed, exhausted from the many years of wandering, and picked up the box. Their parting word were, ""I will be back.""

The skeleton from that point was determined to open the lock. He took challengers from across the continent, and even traveled to foreign lands to compete with the greatest locksmiths ever seen before. It was just a normal day when he see a familiar hunched back figure making it's way towards him. Without a word, the sage placed the same box before him. The skeleton smiled, his bones creaking as skeletons lack the muscles, and the flesh to show that emotion, and uttered one phrase.

One day he has finally saved up enough money so he goes down to the dealer. After picking out the perfect bike, the dealer asks if he would like some extra chrome protection added to the bill. The young man is upset because he does not have the extra money, and is now afraid that the chrome will rust as soon as it gets wet. 


The dealer tells him not to worry. There is an old biker trick that will keep the chrome like new. All he has to do is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains - and everything will be fine. The young man happily pays for the bike and leaves. 

A few months later, the young man meets a woman and falls in love. She asks him to come home and meet her parents over dinner. He readily agrees and the date is set. At the appointment time, he picks her up on his new Harley and they ride to her parents house. Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.

 After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to break and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long fifteen minutes, the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses the woman in front of her family. And no one says a word....... Next he decides to take a more direct approach, so he throws her on the table and makes love to her in front of everyone. And no one says a word..... Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder relations. Yet no one says a word..... By now he is getting very worried and is thinking what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance.

tornados and droughts-not the current situation, where the Wild West means California and you have to brave hottubs, mellowspeak, fires and
earthquakes. That is, it was a simpler time.)

So, Fred found his way to a frontier town and became the bartender at the wildest saloon in the territory. He soon proved how rough and
tough he was, and the owner of the bar was pleased with how he broke up fights and didn't skim too much off the receipts. He told Fred that he (Fred) was doing a fine job, but he should remember one thing: 

""If you ever hear even a rumor that Mad Martin is coming to town, just save what you can, put a bottle of Red Eye on the counter, and head out of
town as fast as you can.""

Fred was pretty perplexed at this, and sought explanation. He was told that Mad Martin was an old mountain man who lived up in the hills
and only came to town once or twice a year. However, Martin was the most dangerous guy they'd ever heard of and few had ever encountered him and lived to tell the tale. 

Fred listened carefully and then promptly forgot all about it. Until, one day a few months later, a cowboy came riding through town at full speed, yelling, ""Martin's coming! Head for the hills!"" The result was incredible. Everybody in town immediately jumped on their horses and took off for the hills. Except Fred. He wanted to see this guy because he didn't believe he could be all that tough. So, Fred just put the bottle of Red Eye on the bar, hid behind the counter, and waited.

He didn't wait long. Soon there was a noise in the street. As Fred looked out a hole in the wall, he saw this huge, mean-looking guy ride down the center of the street on the biggest bull buffalo that Fred had ever seen. The guy stopped the buffalo in front of the bar, jumped off the beast, punched it in the head (dropping the critter to its knees) and bellowed, ""Wait here til I get back!"" 

The fellow turned and walked up the steps. Fred saw that the guy had a pair of huge mountain lions on leashes. He tied them both to a post and kicked them soundly, hollering, ""You pussycats stay here til I'm done!"" The cats fearfully sat down.

Into the bar stormed the fellow, ripping the doors off the wall as he passed. With two strides he approached the bar, picked up the bottle of Red Eye, bit off the neck, and downed it all in one gulp. Poor Fred, thoroughly frightened by now, let out a little whimper. The guy klooked down over the bar and roared, ""What the hell do you think you're looking at!?""

Fred managed to say, ""N..n..n..nothing, mister. Do you want another bottle of Red Eye?"" To which the fellow replied, ""Hell no! I don't have time! I gotta get out of here-Mad Martin's coming!""",1562375334.0,"Once upon a time, this guy named Fred decided that he was rough and tough enough to seek his fortune in the Wild West."

The christian says, ""No, no, I'm a faithful christian, God will save me.""

The lifeboat leaves and, in a few minutes, the water has risen so much that he has to move to his roof.

A helicopter evetually flies in and the pilot yells on the megaphone. ""Come on, we must evacuate!""

The christian shouts, ""No, no, I'm a faithful christian, God will save me.""

The christian dies in the flood, and when he gets to heaven, he says to God, ""I've been a faithful christian all my life, why didn't you save me?""

God then says, ""I sent you a fireman, a lifeboat, and a helicopter. What more help do you need?""",1562351367.0,A christian hears that there is a flood coming to his town. (long)

There's something to do with them burying the person in the end because they become so small that nobody even knows they're there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A yankee goes down to south Louisiana and wants to go duck hunting. He pays and goes duck hunting and says to his guide, ""man that was fun, and that's a mighty fine dog, I oughtta get one.""

&amp;#x200B;

His guide, the sly cajun he is, says, ""Oh, but now son, that ain't no ordinary dog; and you better know they may try and rip you off.""

&amp;#x200B;

He says, ""really?""

&amp;#x200B;

The guide, with sincerity, returns, ""Boudreaux here is a duck dog--he's special made so he can't sink.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, surprised says, ""Really!? he looks like an ordinary dog! how can you tell?""

&amp;#x200B;

The guide squats down by the dog and motions with his finger, ""come here son."" And the man stoops down also. He lifts up his tail and points, saying, ""See how small his butt-hole is?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man, intrigued, says, ""Yeah?\`"" And the guide explains, ""A duck-dogs butt-hole is real small so he can't fill up with water and drown, you hear that?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man perks up and shouts, ""yeah, man, thanks!"" The two shake, and the man heads off, going to get a dog the next day before he leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

As he drives through town, he sees a sign up, ""dogs for sale,"" and he goes and checks'em out. He examines each dog, waiting for someone to come see him. Tibideaux walks up and with a look of horror and shock on his face, says, as calmly as he can, ""Man, what are you doin'!?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man says, ""see, sir, I need a duck dog,""

&amp;#x200B;

Perplexed, Tibideaux says, ""You need you a duck dog?""

&amp;#x200B;

He says, ""Yeah, and I really like this one, but all these, their butt-holes are too big--they'll fill up with water and drown.""

&amp;#x200B;

t3_c9g9wh,3,Jokes,"Timmy loved tractors. His life was all about tractors. Tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything Timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. He knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. When he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. He was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. Timmy seriously loved tractors.

As Timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. He yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new John Deere for his 18th birthday. He could barely contain himself.

Finally, the big day arrived. He was 18! He woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new John Deere tractor. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIMMY! Was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. He ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. He ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. He had never felt this way before!

But enough was enough. It was time.

He climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. It was perfect. He had waited 18 years for this moment. His hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. He quickly turned it and…

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

It didn't start. That's odd. Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Again? This is weird. Bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? Try again.

RRRrrrrrrr CLUNK!

Timmy froze. The tractor wouldn't start. He was let down, betrayed. His whole life up to this point had been a lie. There was a paradigm shift in every fiber of Timmy's being.

Something inside Timmy snapped.

Timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. He ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. Screaming like a possessed Viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. The windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. Then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. He stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.

Timmy walked away, to a bar. He was 18 now, and he needed a drink. He sat down and ordered a beer. Timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. He was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. Thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. Everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. This smoke was from a tractor and it made Timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.

Everybody stared at him in stunned silence. No one moved. The bartender spoke for everyone in the room

Martha is totally fed up with this and then one Thanksgiving morning when she got up early to get things ready, she got an idea while preparing the turkey.

Before Bob got up, she crept upstairs and placed the turkey innards in his pajama bottoms, giggling to herself as she did so.

A little later that morning, Bob woke up and went through his usual morning ritual with glee.

Martha heard a scream as Bob jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom.

She laughed to herself, but when Bob didn't reappear from the bathroom for a long time she started to get concerned.

So she ran upstairs and was just about to knock on the bathroom door, when Bob opened it and came out, pale as a ghost.

He said, ""You were right, honey, you were right! I did fart my guts out, but by the grace of God and these two fingers I got them back up there again!""",1562239433.0,"Bob and Martha have been married for 15 years.

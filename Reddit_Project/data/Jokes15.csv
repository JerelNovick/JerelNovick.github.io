One day the two were playing, when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink. 

Scared for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help! 

Off the chicken ran, back to the farm.. Arriving at the farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no avail, for he had gone to town with the only tractor. 

Running around, the chicken spied the farmer's new Harley. 

Finding the keys in the ignition, the chicken sped off with a length of rope hoping he still had time to save his friend's life. 

Back at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to see the chicken arrive on the shiny Harley, and he managed to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him. 

After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer's bike, the chicken then drove slowly forward and, with the aid of the powerful bike, rescued the horse! 

Happy and proud, the chicken rode the Harley back to the farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned. 

The friendship between the two animals was cemented: Best Buddies, Best Pals. 

A few weeks later, the chicken fell in to a mud pit, and soon, he too, began to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life! 

The horse thought a moment, walked over, and straddled the large puddle. 

Looking underneath, he told the chicken to grab his hangy-down thingy and he would then lift him out of the pit. 

The chicken got a good grip, and the horse pulled him up and out, saving his life.

""Well you see, I was born like this, and because of it I've never gotten close to a man, I've never even hugged one.""

The man contemplates this for a second before shrugging. 'What the hell.' He thinks to himself, so without saying a word he picks her up and gives her a great big hug, and then gently sets her down.

""There, I hope that makes your day at least a little bit better."" He says, before starting to walk away.

However he only gets about 5 feet away before he can hear her start to cry again.

""Aw, now what's wrong darling?"" He asks

""Well, since I had never hugged a man, obviously I've never been kissed either.."" she answered sheepishly.

The man thinks for a moment again, before again coming to the conclusion that why not? So this time he walks up to her and stoops down, puts his hand on her cheek and gives her a deep and passionate kiss. He then stands back up and takes a step back.

"" Alright, well I've really got to be going now, but again, I hope that helps"" he said as he again started to walk away.

This time he gets about ten feet away before he hears her crying again, this time quite loudly. The man sighs to himself, getting quite annoyed, but not wanting to see a woman cry, he turns around again.

""Now what's wrong??"" He says, barely keeping his voice civil.

""Well since I'd never even been kissed, obviously no one has ever wanted to make love to me."" She replied, tears still streaming down her face.

This caused the man to really think, he barely knew this woman, and he was definitely going to be late if he gave in to this latest request. However he couldn't stand to see her so sad, so finally he walked over to her and picked her up.

""Dont worry honey, I'll take care of you"" he said with a wink.

As he approached the first stop on his route he could see some poor soul laying on the bench. He stopped the bus, opened the doors and called out to the soaking wet person laying there.

""Hey, buddy!"" The guy sat up and looked as wet and cold as he was drunk. ""Hey fella, get outta the rain and on the bus.""

""I can't"", mumbled the drunk, ""I don't haff any money.""

""Nevermind that, get on the bus"", said the driver kindly. So the drunk staggers up the steps and plonks down in the seat across from the driver. He looked so bedraggled and sad that the driver wanted to make him feel at least a little bit happier.

So he says to the drunk, ""Hey, buddy, hey watch this!""

He stops the bus and a sour-looking older woman gets on, shaking her umbrella. She deposits her fare, and as she goes past the driver, he says, ""Tickle your c#nt with a feather?""

The woman wheels around, ""What did you say?!!""

The driver answers, ""Typical country weather....Don't you agree?""

The woman is red-faced and embarrassed at what she thought she heard and mumbles yes, she agrees and sits herself well down the back.

The drunk is smiling a bit, so the driver knows its having a positive effect. ""Watch this one"", he says.

Sure enough, at the next stop another woman gets on. She looks like she's never cracked a smile in her life. As she drops in her fare and starts to move past the driver, he mumbles, ""Tickle your snatch with a feather?""

The woman gasps and says,""I beg your pardon?!!""

To which the driver answers, ""I said typical nasty weather.""

The woman is completely shaken and apologises and agrees, yes the weather is atrocious. Then hurries to her seat.

Now the drunk is chuckling quite freely.

The driver leans over and says to the drunk, ""Why don't you do the next one?""

The drunk shakes his head, ""No, I'm too dr-dr-drunk."" ""Nah"", says the driver, ""you do this one.""

So as the bus stops, the drunk pulls himself up straight in the seat, smooths his clothes out and stares straight ahead. His face is a study in concentration. As the lady pays her fare and begins to pass by the drunk, he says in a clear, strong voice, ""SCRATCH YER C#NT WITH A STICK?""

Ethel says, ""No, the ride is $50, and $50 is $50.""

So they leave, and come back about 20 years later, now the couple is in their 60's. Again, the husband sees the helicopter and the sign, still $50. ""Come on Ethel, we didn't do it the last time we were here, let's do it now."" ""No, it's still $50, and $50 is $50.""

So once again they leave without riding the helicopter. They come back again in another 20 years. They're 80 now, the husband sees the same sign. He begs his wife, ""Ethel please, I've waited my whole life to ride that helicopter. We're never going to get another chance, can we please just ride the helicopter?"" Again, the wife says ""No, $50 is $50."" The helicopter pilot was in earshot this time and says to the couple, ""I couodn't help but overhear you two. I'll take you on the helicopter ride for free, but if you make a sound, or say anything, you have to pay the $50."" The couple agrees.

The pilot is trying to pull a fast one on the couple, he wants to get paid. So he's doing all kinds of tricks, all these flips and barrel rolls and all kinds of crazy stuff to get them to scream and speak up. Nothing from the couple. Not a word was said, no screaming, nothing. The pilot lands the helicopter and says, ""That was amazing, I didn't hear anything from you two, how'd you do it?""

Bob, disappointed he didn’t get the judges to laugh as much as he wanted, shakes his head at it and reassures himself it’s a fluke and he will rock the crowd on Saturday.
 

Saturday rolls around and Bob is next to go on stage. He gets up there and starts. His act is insane and wacky. Bob the ant is going nuts. But the crowd isn’t laughing. Disappointedly, Bob walks off stage to the audience after his set to reflect on why he wasn’t so funny. As he does this, the next ant comedian walks on stage. His name is Tom, and Tom has a much more relaxed and chill vibe to him than Bob. Tom is killing it. Every sentence makes the crowd roar with laughter.

So the pig and chicken run up to the farmers house and they bang on the door, no answer... again they bang on the door, no answer.

In a fury the chicken busts down the door and grabs the keys to the Mercedes parked out front. Then the two of them grab some rope.
The pig then drives down to the mud hole and attaches one end of the rope to the horse and the other to the bumper. 

The pig then pulls the horse out with the Mercedes.

The next day, the three of them are walking again and the chicken falls into the same hole.
The pig begins to say “I know what to do!” and begins to run back to the house, but the horse stops him and says “hold on, watch this”.

So he makes his way to Zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the Gods. Along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. Their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. The hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. A ways further and he sees Hercules, Chuck Norris, and even Atlas, who held up the sky for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. The hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. If these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could I? But the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.
  

The hero had finally reached Zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. ""Welcome, great hero. If you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. Here is a jar of peanut butter. Please open the jar without using any hot water."" The hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.
  

""Very good"" says Zeus. ""For the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs."" As a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. He picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to Zeus's refrigerator.
  

""You give me hope, challenger! Perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. The feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! I have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. Retrieve the sword for me and I will present you the final challenge."" The hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. He notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. He presents the sword to Zeus.
  

""Hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. No mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as Hercules, Chuck Norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. Complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary Pantheon.

t3_cadbzz,0,Jokes,"This is a true story, inasmuch as any story is true. I once lived in a small town in a rural part of Oregon and worked as the night desk clerk at a motel just across from a truck stop. One night a customer came in wearing bib overalls over a flannel shirt and asked for a room for a couple weeks, paying all in advance.

He explained he was a nearby farmer who was having his house expanded because he had three girlfriends who were all going to move in with him. It was late at night, so I didn't mind a little conversation to break the monotony. Well, over that next couple weeks, he was a regular for our continental breakfast and we'd chat. He was a friendly enough guy, but I did notice he was a pretty heavy drinker. Some nights I knew would be dead, we'd share a fifth of bourbon in our lobby.

Well, eventually the two weeks was up, and he got a call. Since we'd gotten to be pals, he asked if I wouldn't like to come out and see the house and meet his three girlfriends. I had kind of forgotten about his swinging by that point, but I figured what the hell, why not.

We climb into his pickup, and it's a pretty good ride from my work site out to his farm. It's a pretty decent size acreage, and toward the back is a really nicely done farmhouse. We step up onto the wide porch and the front door opens to display a naked woman standing there. Just stark naked. Now that would've been pretty nice, except this girl is sorta... unfortunate-looking.

Tall, painfully skinny, stringy blonde hair. It's like somebody taught a mop to stand upright and walk around.

My friend leans down and says, ""I don't rightly remember her actual name, I jus' call her Corona.""

I didn't know what to say to that, so I kinda stumble out with, ""Because she's, uhhh... cool and refreshing?""

He laughs. ""Naw, 'cause I was drunk as hell after a case of Corona when I hooked up with 'er!""

The woman leads us into the living room, and we sit. She brings us each a nice cold beer. Just then the bedroom door opens and out comes a second woman. The farmer grins real big and I look.

Well, she's about five foot even and probably 350 pounds or more. Face like a pug, hair like a scorched tumbleweed, and a scowl that would make a rattler think twice about biting her. The farmer says, ""This here's Tequila!""

I didn't know what to even say to that except: ""Why would you name her...""

""Yup, 'at's right!"" he guffaws. ""I's blackout drunk on Patron when I hooked up with 'er!""

At this point I'm just sitting there with a thousand yard stare. And then I hear it. The sound nobody ever wants to hear, the sound everybody who's seen an old horror film knows instinctively.

From somewhere in the back of the house, the door of what could only have been a fruit cellar starts to s-l-o-w-l-y *crrrrrrrreeeeaaaak* open.

Eventually, the party is caught by a group of tribals and put in a cage. The chief of the tribals approaches them, and tells them the situation. 

""We need to kill you three so we can turn your skin into canoes. But because we are honorable, we are going to let you choose how you die.""

The Brit raises his hand and asks the cheif if he can have a gun. The chief obliges and hands the man a gun. He yells ""God save the Queen"" and blow his brains out. Then the Frenchman raises his hand and asks the chief for a vial of poison. The chief hands him a vial of cyannide, at which point the Frenchman yells ""Vive le France!"" And chugs it, killing him as well. Finally, the chief looks at the gangster, and asks him how he wishes to die. 

""Gimmie a fork, tribal boy.""

The chief, confused, hands the man a metal fork, and watches as he starts stabbing himself with it over and over again.

In fact, since I’m also an orphan, I don’t even know what I am.”  “It’s quite OK,” replied the snake. “Actually, my story is much the same as yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and find out what you are, so at least you’ll have that going for you.”  “Oh, that would be wonderful” replied the bunny.
